  <article class="post-content">
    <p>The dipped headlamp bulb blew on my Alfa Romeo GTV the other day and I spent way too long today working out how to replace it. What’s more, there didn’t seem to be clear instructions that I could find on the net, so I thought the decent thing to do would be to write it up here.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>First off, there is <a href="http://www.alfaowner.com/Forum/alfa-gtv-and-916-spider/234333-headlight-bulbs-gtv.html">confusion about correct part numbers</a>. Several newsgroup posts say that Halfords’ part numbers are mixed up between full and dipped bulbs. Even my local Alfa dealership sold me the wrong one. I discovered that Halfords’ paper part finder in their store was correct, yet <a href="http://www.halfords.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/GenericProductGuidedSalesCmd?action=getProducts&amp;storeId=10001&amp;categoryId=165538&amp;catalogId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;vrn=&amp;rememberMe=1&amp;storeId=10001&amp;catalogId=10151&amp;categoryId=165538&amp;langId=-1&amp;engineInd=0&amp;makeName=10&amp;modelName=1006&amp;dvlaYear=38&amp;subset=1006050&amp;findPartsMMYS=Find+parts">their systems were wrong</a>. Either way, you need bulb number 9005 for the dipped headlamp.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dipped_headlamp_bulb.jpg" alt="dipped headlamp bulb showing part number" /></p>

<p>Once you have a replacement bulb, you’ll need to remove the plastic cover over the side of the engine bay</p>

<p><img src="/images/engine_bay_cover.jpg" alt="engine bay cover" /></p>

<p>There are four large cross-head screws holding it in place</p>

<p><img src="/images/removing_cover_screws.jpg" alt="dipped removing first screw from cover" /></p>

<p>Once this cover is removed, the rear of the headlight assembly should be as accessible as it’s going to get</p>

<img src="/images/rear_headlight_assembly.jpg" alt="the rear of the headlamp cluster" />
    <figcaption>(sorry, the pictures are a little out of sequence - the bulb has already been removed in this shot)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then remove the clip holding the cable on to the back of the bulb. There are two little prongs that hold the clip in place - they should lift easily then the connector pulls off.</p>

<p><img src="/images/rear_dipped_headlamp_bulb.jpg" alt="in-situ bulb closeup" /></p>

<p>Turn the bulb about 45 degrees anti-clockwise and then it should slide out without fuss.</p>

<p>Put your new bulb in, twisting it into place so the connector is facing downwards as the last picture above shows, carefully avoiding putting your fingers on the bulb itself. Do make sure to test that the new bulb is working, then reverse the steps above and you should be good to go.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>
